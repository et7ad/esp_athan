**Bill Of Materials**

The full, PCB‑level Bill Of Materials for this project is exported directly from the KiCad hardware project and lives next to the PCB files:

- CSV: `hardware/pcb/athanV1_PCB/BOM.csv`
- Excel: `hardware/pcb/athanV1_PCB/BOM.xlsx`

Those two files are generated from the schematic/layout in `hardware/pcb/athanV1_PCB/athanV1.kicad_sch` / `hardware/pcb/athanV1_PCB/athanV1.kicad_pcb` and are the **authoritative source** for part numbers, quantities, and footprints when ordering or assembling the board.

If you are sending the board to a PCB assembly house, use the CSV as the reference BOM. If you prefer to browse or tweak the list manually (e.g. to swap vendors or part numbers), open the Excel file.

For enclosure, wiring and general hardware notes, see:

- `README.md` section “Building your own device (hardware and assembly)”
- `WIRING.md` for pinout and wiring details.
